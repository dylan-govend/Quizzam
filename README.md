# Quizzam
Our team has decided to create an interactive quiz based on Maths and English called Quizzam. The aim is to allow students to work on their basic Maths and English skills as well as allow parents to monitor their child’s progress without the pressure of a test. Parents and teachers will have the added opportunity to create their own quizzes so they can adjust the questions as they deem fit for each student/child. Students will be presented with standard generated quiz questions and answers which will vary from easy to difficult.

The quiz focuses on the key building blocks of the South African Education System which are Mathematics and English. The main reason for Maths and English being chosen as they are needed in the National Senior Certificate examinations for entrance into any university should students want to further their studies. Other than entrance into university; reading, writing, and solving math calculations help exercise their cognitive ability and relearn important concepts. Quizzam focuses on these subjects as it not only helps improve a student’s academics, but it stimulates their cognitive ability.

Quizzam’s main focus is quizzes based on Math and English however we have added a third category which will allow the user to train their memory ability, a simple memory card game. This was added to act as a stress reliever during each quiz and allows the user's mind to reset before they take the next quiz. This also ensures that the user can refocus and reactivate their memorising ability (which is usually unused in the Education System).
